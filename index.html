                <p class="hidden">My name is Mandy and I have spent the last five years teaching middle school science
                    around Durango, CO. My husband Devon and I welcomed a baby boy into the world during the 
                    COVID-19 pandemic and have since decided to make the move up to Denver to be closer to family. I took this year
                    off from teaching and discovered that I have a real love for coding. This is my first 
                    website and I'm excited to dive into this field and learn more!
